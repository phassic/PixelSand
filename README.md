Falling Sand Simulation with Magic Dust

This project is an interactive falling sand simulation built using Pygame, where you can create and observe the behavior of different particles such as sand, water, and "Magic Dust." The simulation allows you to control gravity, wind, and grid size dynamically, as well as choose from different types of Magic Dust for added visual effects.

Features:

Particles: Sand, Water, and Magic Dust particles with unique behaviors.
Magic Dust Types:
Star Dust: Gold and pastel colors.
Fairy Sparkles: Purples and pinks.
Rainbow Mist: Vibrant neon colors.

Controls:
Gravity and Wind: Adjust the gravity and wind strength in the simulation.
Grid Size: Change the grid size for a different level of detail.
Magic Dust Activation: Toggle the Magic Dust mode on and off.
Sand Glue: Toggle sand particles' ability to stick in place.
Magic Dust Picker: Choose between different Magic Dust types.


How to Use:

Mouse Controls:
Left Click: Place sand or Magic Dust particles.
Right Click: Place water particles.

UI Controls:

Gravity Slider: Adjust the gravity from -10 (upward) to 10 (downward).
Wind Slider: Adjust the wind strength.
Grid Size Slider: Change the size of the grid cells (2-20).
Magic Dust Button: Toggle Magic Dust mode to create special particles.
Sand Glue Button: Toggle whether sand particles stick in place.
Magic Dust Picker: Select the type of Magic Dust to use.
